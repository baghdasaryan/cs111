	<h2 id="issues">Issues with VSWC</h2>
		<p>In the last section, we introduced a Very Secured Word Counter (VSWC) -
			a standalone application that securely counts number of words in a
			given file. Here we will cover different issues related to VSWC&#39;s
			implementation as well as introduce you to the principle of modularity.</p>
		<p>Some problems with our standalone application are:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Poor performance</li>
			<li>It wastes disk space since it keeps multiple copies of the
				same <i>read_sector</i> function for BIOS, MBR, and VSWC.</li>
			<li>It is hard to modify, maintain and debug.</li>
			<li>It is hard to reuse parts of our program anywhere else (i.e. in
				other programs). Cut and Paste does not scale when developing
				real-world systems.</li>
			<li>Cannot run VSWC with other programs concurrently. For example, if
				Microsoft Word and VSWC run at the same time, they may compete for
				various resources while calling <i>read_sector</i>.</li>
			<li>Current implementation does not have any error-checking or recovery
				mechanisms.</li>
		</ol>

	<h2 id="performanceIssues">Performance Issues</h2>
		<p>First, we will focus on VSWC&#39;s performance issues. We will cover
			three major ways of improving program performance:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Using larger I/O Buffer</li>
			<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_buffering">Double Buffering</a></li>
			<li>Using <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_memory_access">DMA</a> instead of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmed_input/output">PIO</a></li>
		</ol>
		<p>Other ways, like getting a faster drive (e.g. 
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID">SSD</a>) or going
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID">RAID</a>, are possible but
			will not be discussed here.</p>

	<h3 id="largerBuffer">Larger I/O Buffer</h3>
		<p>Let&#39;s consider the case when data processing takes less time
			than reading data into a buffer.</p>
			
		<img src="pictures\larger_io_buffer\larger_io_buffer_1.png" alt="small_buffer" />
			
		<p>As it can be seen from the above picture, a lot of time is spent on
			reading data into a buffer and context-switching. Increasing
			the the buffer size would result in minimizing the time program
			spends on switching between reading and processing
			(context-switching), as shown below.</p>
			
		<img src="pictures\larger_io_buffer\larger_io_buffer_2.png" alt="large_buffer" />
			
		<p>Method pros and cons:</p>
		<blockquote><div>
			<b>+</b> Batching lessens overhead (assuming that we read data
				from big files).<br />
			<b>--</b> Memory issue -- program can run out of memory (RAM)
				while reading data into a buffer, in case the buffer size
				is bigger than the RAM. So, we actually might have a
				problem with choosing a correct size for the buffer.<br />
			<b>--</b> Wasted work for small files -- program will be
				getting too much of unnecessary data in case if
				provided file is small.
		</div></blockquote>
		
	<h3 id="doubleBuffer">Double Buffering</h3>
		<p>Now, let&#39;s look at the case when data processing takes as much
			time as copying data from disk to RAM does.</p>
		
		<img src="pictures\double_buffering\double_buffering_1.png" alt="single_buffer" />
			
		<p>In this case, we have a single buffer. As it can be seen from
			above figure, CPU and I/O devices each have large idling time,
			because one has to wait for the other one to finish, before
			it can start its own task. This scheme has an occupancy issue,
			since only one device can do useful work at a time.</p>
			
		<p>Double buffering is one of the ways to solve this problem. It
			allows CPU to work on data from the first buffer while I/O
			writes to the second one, and then they switch. This is
			illustrated in the figure below.</p>
			
		<img src="pictures\double_buffering\double_buffering_2.png" alt="dual_buffers" />
			
		<p>As it can be seen from the above figure, reading and processing
			happen almost in parallel when we take advantage of double
			buffering.</p>
			
		<p>Method pros and cons:</p>
		<blockquote><div>
			<b>+</b> No idle time => Double buffering lowers the execution
				time by a factor of 2 if CPUtime ~ I/O time, but it is
				still faster than a single buffer even if CPUtime != I/O
				time.<br />
			<b>--</b> Twice as much RAM is needed
		</div></blockquote>
			
		<p><b><i>Question:</i></b> We just showed that double buffering
			doubles the speed of the program, will triple buffering
			decrease execution time by a factor of 3?<br />
		<b>Answer:</b> No, one buffer would be extra for several reasons:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>In this case we assume that CPUtime = I/O time</li>
			<li>If CPUtime &lt; I/O time: triple buffering does not make any
				sense; we would need multiple disks to support multiple
				buffers</li>
			<li>If CPUtime > I/O time: triple buffering does not make any
				sense</li>
		</ol>
		<p>It might be useful to draw diagrams to understand the above	answer.</p>
		
	<h3 id="dma">DMA</h3>
		<p>In VSWC, we used <i>insl</i> extensively as our method for copying
			data from hard disk to RAM. However, <i>insl</i> instruction is
			slow. As it was designed, it transports data from the disk to CPU,
			and then to RAM. Since all three components (disk, CPU and RAM)
			shares the same bus, this method is effectively occupying it for
			twice as long as is needed, slowing down other parts of the system
			as many operations require the shared bus to be free. Figure below
			shows how <i>insl</i> works.</p>
			
		<img src="pictures\dma\dma_1.png" alt="pio" />
		
		<p>To correct this problem, we can use a method of data transport
			known as Direct Memory Access (DMA) to access data on disk.
			In DMA, disk controller issues the transfer of data to the
			RAM directly, skipping the middle-man â€“ CPU. In this way, bus
			used only one time (instead of two as in the case of PIO), 
			which improves the overall performance of our program.
			Following graph shows an example of Direct Memory Access.</p>

	<h2 id="modularity">Modularity</h2>
		<p>In the above section we attempted to solve the problem of VSWC's poor 
			performance. Here, we will redirect our attention to problems of 
			modifying, maintaining, debugging and reusing previously written code.
			Using modularity and abstraction is one of the ways to attempt solving
			these issues.</p>
	
	<h3 id="modularityOverview">Overview</h3>	
		<p><i>Modularity</i> is a degree to which system's components may be
			separated and recombined. In other words, modularity represents how
			well a big system can be broken into manageable pieces, which can be
			changed without a need to alter other modules. We use it to break big
			programs into parts, mainly improve the maintenance.</p>
		
		<p><b><i>Example:</i></b> Analyzing the effect of Modularity on finding
			and fixing bugs.</p>
		Notation:
		<ul style="list-style: none;">
			<li>N: number of code lines.</li>
			<li>B: number of bugs in the code.</li>
			<li>T: amount of time necessary to find and fix a bug.</li>
			<li>T<sub>total</sub>: amount of time necessary to find and
				fix all the bugs.</li>
			<li>M: number of modules we in the program.</li>
		</ul>
		
		Now, let's consider two scenarios:
		<ol>
			<li><i>Program written without paying attention to modularity</i><br />
				Number of bugs B &prop; N<br />
				Time to fix a bug is T &prop; N<br />
				Thus, time to find and fix all the bugs would be
					T<sub>total</sub> = O(N*N) = O(N<sup>2</sup>)</li>
			<li><i>Modular program</i><br />
				Let's assume that bugs are distributed evenly among M
					modules, and each module has N/M lines of code.<br />
				Then, T is proportional to N/M, and T<sub>total</sub> =
					O((N/M) * N) = O(N<sup>2</sup>/M)</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Comparing cases (1) and (2), we see that with M modules, we reduce 
			the amount of time to find and fix all bugs to 1/M of the original
			time (without modules).</p>
					
		<b><i>Question:</i></b> Does it mean that the more modules we use the
			easier it will be to maintain the program?<br />
		<b>Answer:</b> Having too many modules can result in bugs
			interlaying between functions and files, which means that we
			would need to consult several modules to find a single bug,
			and that will be against the idea of using modularity.

	<h4 id="modularityMetrics">Modularity Metrics</h4>
		<p>One of the ways to decide what kind of modularization to choose is
			to consult modularity metrics:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><i>Simplicity</i> â€“ modularization should be easy to learn,
				remember, use, document, etc.</li>
			<li><i>Robustness</i> â€“ modules should work well independent of
				conditions, tolerate faults, reduce noise.</li>
			<li><i>Flexibility</i> â€“ each module should have as few
				assumptions	of other modules as possible.</li>
			<li><i>Performance</i> â€“ good modularization should not be an
				inherent resource burden.</li>
		</ol>
		
	<h4 id="supportingModularity">Supporting Modularity</h4>
		<p>Supporting modularity is a very good as well as important coding
			practice. In order to support modularity, it is discouraged to use
			lots of global variables and to create one function that does all
			the work. Global variables may introduce undefined behaviors when
			changed from different functions, while one huge function (just 
			like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">Turing
			Machine</a>)is incapable of supporting modularity.</p>
			
		<p>Here are three basic methods one can follow for creating modular
			code:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Using functions/procedures/routines/methods</li>
			<li>Client-Server modularity</li>
			<li>Virtualization</li>
		</ul>
		
	<h3 id="softModularity">Soft Modularity</h3>	
		<p>Soft modularity can be though as a division of a big program into
			small independent blocks without using any "special" (e.g. hardware)
			techniques. Function modularity can serve as a nice example of soft
			modularity.</p>
	
	<h4 id="functionalModularity">Functional Modularity</h4>
		<p>Separating code into functions separates processes from each other.
			This allows each process to be considered individually, which makes
			the debugging much easier. In addition, functional modularity allows 
			functions to be reused in different programs, which makes the code
			even more modular.</p>
		
		<p>Recursion is a special case of function call where the caller is
			also the callee. We shall examine the code for a factorial function
			as an example.</p>
		
		<pre class="brush: c;">
		int fact(int n) {
			if (n == 0) 
				return 1;
			return n * fact(n-1);	
		}
		</pre>
		
		<p>And here is how the ASSEMBLY code for this function would look like:</p>
		<pre class="brush: asm;">
		fact:
			pushl %ebp				; *--sp = bp
			movl $1, %eax			; ax = 1
			movl %esp, %ebp			; bp = sp
			subl $8, %esp			; sp = sp -8
			movl %ebx, -4(%ebp)		; bp[-1] = bx
			movl 8(%ebp), %ebx		; bx = bp[2]
			testl %ebx, %ebx		; if (n != 0)
			jne .L5					;     goto .L5
		.L1	movl -4(%ebp), %ebx		; bx = bp[-1]
			movl %ebp, %esp			; sp = bp
			popl %ebp				; bp = *sp++
			ret						; ip = *sp++
		.L5	leal -1(%ebx), %eax		; ax = bx -1
			movl %eax, (%esp)		; *sp = ax
			call fact				; *sp++ = ip    // ip = fact
			imull %ebx, %eax		; ax = ax * bx
			jmp .L1
		</pre>
		
		<p>Soft modularity depends on modules working together. There is a
			certain amount of trust between the caller and the callee. In
			consequence, any errors suffered by one module may propagate into
			another, as modularity is not enforced and the contract may be
			broken regardless of programmer's intentions.</p>
		
		<p>A caller-callee contract (i.e. an agreement between the 
			caller and callee of the function) is necessary for creating
			functional modularity, so that this process would work without
			security breaches and/or bugs.</p>
			
		<p>The unwritten caller-callee contract consists of the following
			conditions:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>sp[0] = return address</li>
			<li>sp[1] = n (return value)</li>
			<li>sp[i] = i-th variable</li>
			<li>at return:
				<ul>
					<li>%eax holds return value (can hold any value during
						execution)</li>
					<li>%ebx,%ebp are unchanged (can hold any value during
						execution)</li>
					<li>%esp = old %esp + 4 (it is callee's responsibility to
						pop the return address)</li>
				</ul></li>
			<li>all stack spaces in callee must be unchanged</li>
			<li>there is enough stack space (16*n + 8 bytes)</li>
			<li>callee must set ip to sp[0], not return to a random location,
				and not loop forever</li>
		</ul>
			
		<p>Anything can go wrong in the case if caller-callee contract is
			violated. Thus, in order to have enforced modularity, it is necessary
			to use external mechanisms that limit interaction between modules.</p>
			
	<h3 id="hardModularity">Hard Modularity</h3>
	
	<h4 id="clientServerModularity">Client-Server Modularity</h4>
		<p>Hard modularity restricts interaction between modules and validates
			expected results from a module. One way to do is this by organizing
			modules as clients and services, which communicate through requests
			and responses respectively.</p>
			
		<p>Hard modularity is enforced because since the client and the
			service do not share memory, and modules can check the validity of
			the messages sent between them. In consequence, hard modularity via
			client/service is much slower than soft modularity.</p>
			
		<p>In the factorial example, hard modularity can be implemented with a
			web service available at a URL such as 
			<a href="http://factorial.cs.ucla.edu/fact=23">http://factorial.cs.ucla.edu/fact=23</a>
			and the factorial of 23 would be printed in the browser. In this
			example factorial.cs.ucla.edu is the service and the browser is the
			client. If for some reason the web service goes into an infinite
			loop is becomes unavailable, the browser as an automatic response
			to stop waiting for a response or to display an availability error.</p>
			
		<p>Conceptually the service and the client are on separate computers
			but using the OS, the two modules can exist on the same computer.</p>
		
	<h4 id="virtualizationModularity">Virtualization</h4>
		<p>We can simulate the client/server organization on one computer by
			using virtualization. This means that a separate virtual computer
			is used to execute a module.</p>
			
		<p>For example in the case of the factorial function, using a virtual
			x86 machine we can have an instruction called factl which produces
			the same results as that stores its return value in %eax. The factl
			instruction executes in a virtual memory and eliminates the
			possibility of memory overwriting from other modules.</p>
			
		<p>Virtualization causes extra overhead and we need to speed up the
			process for it to be usable.</p>
