Response to Exercise 1:

The name of the scheduling algorithm is: Round Robin


(Exercise 2 is a coding exercise)


Response to Exercise 3:

Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 0: 1278.5 ms
Average turnaround time for scheduling_algorithm 1: 800 ms

Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 0: 1.5 ms
Average wait time for scheduling_algorithm 1: 480 ms


Exercise 4:

Did you complete Exercise 4A, Exercise 4B, or both for extra credit? Both, for extra credit.
	Exercise 4A: Completed!
	Exercise 4B: Completed!

Exercise 5:
During execution of process 4.

(Exercise 6 is a coding exercise)

Extra credit exercises: set extra_credit_on boolean inside schedos-1.c, use PART_ON (in schedos.h) to switch between parts

Exercise 7:
For this question, I implemented the lottery scheduling algorithm. I used a random number generator to get a randomized number that was used to schedule waiting processes.

Exercise 8: Completed!
