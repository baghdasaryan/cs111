Response to Exercise 1:
	Replacing run(current) clause with schedule() causes processes not
execute momentarily (sometimes), which means that scheduler will decide what
process should execute and when (while we need this process to run
immediately). Since this system does not provide memory isolation, one process
can access and modify another process's memory (e.g. change pid). In other
words, if scheduler run an intermediary process, that process might modify
our pid.
	Answer: sys_getpid() might not return the correct value.
